      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>Rescue Over-Cooked Rice</h3>
          <p>Don't worry if your rice turns into porridge! Simply place a slice of bread on top and heat it for another two minutes. The bread will absorb the excess moisture, saving your dish.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Reclaim Leftover Frying Oil</h3>
          <p>Got leftover black oil after frying food? Mix 1 spoonful of starch with 1 spoonful of water until well combined. Heat the oil until it's 60% hot, then add the starch mixture. It will absorb impurities, clearing up the oil. Once the starch solidifies, remove it and enjoy your refined oil.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>De-Oil Excessively Oily Soup</h3>
          <p>Too much oil in your soup? Here's a quick fix! Place some ice cubes in a spoon and swirl the soup. The cooling oil will stick to the bottom of the spoon. Remove the oily layer and repeat if needed. Your soup will be oil-free in no time!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Rapid Defrosting of Frozen Meat</h3>
          <p>Never soak frozen meat directly in water again! Instead, sprinkle 300gm of salt and 20ml of vinegar on it, then soak in warm water for just 3 minutes. The defrosted meat will be incredibly tender and even tastier than fresh meat!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Extend Banana Freshness</h3>
          <p>Bananas going bad too quickly? Wrap the stem in plastic wrap or aluminium foil to keep them fresh for a longer period.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Store Potatoes Effectively</h3>
          <p>Too many potatoes to handle. Store them in a basket with an apple to prevent sprouting and keep them fresh for longer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Natural Microwave Cleaner</h3>
          <p>Clean your microwave effortlessly! Fill a microwave-safe bowl with water, add slices of lemon, and microwave for a few minutes. The grime will loosen, making cleaning a breeze.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Soft Brown Sugar Hack</h3>
          <p>Keep brown sugar soft and scoopable by storing it with a slice of apple or an orange peel in an airtight container. Alternatively, microwave brown sugar next to a small glass of water for a quick fix â€“ the moisture will break up the block of sugar.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Check Egg Freshness</h3>
          <p>Wondering if your eggs are still good? Gently place uncooked eggs in a bowl of cold water. If they sink, they're edible; if they float, they've gone bad. This hack works because the liquid inside eggs evaporates over time, leaving a gas bubble that makes them float.</p>
